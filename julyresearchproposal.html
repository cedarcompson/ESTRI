      <h2>Three-Month Intentional Community Research Residency Proposal</h2>
      <p>The Emergent Systems and Transience Research Institute (ESTRI) is a living research project dedicated to understanding who individuals, communities, and systems can become when allowed to emerge wholly as themselves. We study emergence as becoming, and transience as intentional movement and impermanence.</p>
      <p>Intentional communities are at the heart of these properties. We are currently seeking partner communities to pilot a three-month embedded research residency.</p>
      <p>An ESTRI researcher is trained in trauma-informed dynamics, communication archetypes, social system observation, and non-extractive documentation. Our researchers also bring technical, organizational, and relational infrastructure-building skills—including community-specific data systems, bespoke facilitation training, emergent leadership models, and support for clarity in both structure and care.</p>
      <p>The residency follows a three-phase arc:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Month 1: Observation, Participation, Learning</strong><br>The researcher integrates slowly—learning the rhythms, relationships, and needs of the community.</li>
        <li><strong>Month 2: Co-Creation</strong><br>Based on observations, the researcher works with community members to design and prototype tools, structures, or processes that serve the existing flow—never overriding it.</li>
        <li><strong>Month 3: Modeling & Transition</strong><br>The researcher supports others in using and embodying the tools created. Leadership, facilitation, and documentation are handed off—scaffolding autonomy, not dependence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At the end of the residency, the researcher exits with care. We design our departure from day one—not out of detachment, but to ensure what’s built can live independently. Ongoing relationship is always possible: follow-up, future visits, and care-based connection are offered but never assumed.</p>
      <p>ESTRI is fundamentally non-extractive. We do not study communities as subjects—we enter them as collaborators. We seek to listen, respond, build together, and leave behind clarity, tools, and frameworks that reflect who the community already is.</p>

      <h2>Current Researcher Placement</h2>
      <p><strong>Time Frame:</strong> July – September </p>
      <p>We are currently seeking a partner community for a three-month field residency for our research director, Cedar Compson, who is in the process of prototyping ESTRI’s embedded research framework.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="about">
      <h2>Researcher About</h2>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cedarcompson/ESTRI/refs/heads/main/Cedar%20Selfie.jpeg" alt="Non-Binary Field Researcher in Desert" width="250" height="333">
      <p><strong>Cedar Compson (they/them)</strong> is a founding ESTRI researcher, a systems theorist, and an embedded community researcher specializing in emergent intelligence, trauma-informed facilitation, and relational systems design. With a background spanning data architecture, educational practice, and technical infrastructure, Cedar brings over seven years of experience working at the intersection of community technology and decentralized systems. They hold a B.A. in English and an A.S. in Biotechnology, and approach research through a transdisciplinary lens informed by both formal and autodidactic study, and extensive lived experience.</p>
      <p>Their current work explores the structural properties of transience, emergent community properties, and cognition. They are particularly focused on developing field methodologies for observing and documenting community behavior without imposing external paradigms, and for building tools that reinforce autonomy, mutuality, and decentralization. As a neurodivergent, transgender, and disabled individual, their research is rooted in personal and collective experience of marginalization, precarity, and survival outside dominant systems.</p>
      <p>Cedar’s approach is field-oriented, non-extractive, and embedded. Their presence within community spaces centers on reciprocal contribution, ethical observation, and the creation of infrastructure designed to outlast their role. Their work seeks to build frameworks that communities can carry forward independently – and to study what becomes possible when communities are seen and supported how they are.</p>

    <section id="needs">
      <h2>Current Research Needs and Exchange</h2>
      <p><em>ESTRI is in the process of obtaining grant funding to secure transportation and mobile living accommodations for our researchers. We are still in the early stages, though, and need some support throughout our placements.</em></p>
      <p>Currently, our research placement needs are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transportation assistance into community</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Living accommodations for duration of placement.</strong> We are happy to help with creation or cleaning of a space if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Animal acceptance and accommodations.</strong> Our researchers may have their own animals to provide support through the research period. <em>Please note our current research placement, Cedar, has a 2.5 rescue pit-mix slowly training to be a PTSD support dog.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Assistance securing food and water for duration of stay.</strong> ESTRI is currently able to provide a moderate food stipend, but assistance with transportation to grocery stores, access to a community kitchen, and some community food access are deeply helpful to our researchers.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to Internet.</strong> If unable to access in direct living accommodation, community access works for us. Our researchers are trained in low-tech methodologies that retain shape even when offline.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our researchers are trained in survival skills and have lived experience in edge community systems and with direct survival management. They are low-waste, resource aware, and are happy to contribute some physical labor (within ability levels) in addition to research and system production.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts on ESTRI Residency</h2>
        <p>ESTRI is, by definition, a non-extractive research institute. We want to come learn from you, understand who your community is, teach what we feel we can offer, and grow with you.</p>
        <p>Our larger research focuses on emergent properties of individuals, communities, and systems. We define emergent properties as the characteristics that arise when a being or structure is forced or allowed to be. These characteristics cannot be broken down into constituent parts. We see this as part of sociology, but more broadly as part of the study of cognition.</p>
        <p><em>How do various intelligences interact and create together?</em></p>
        <p>Our residencies are structured, but never rigid. We hold form lightly, always oriented toward relational integrity and clarity. We know that communities are not control groups—they are living systems with unique rhythms, frictions, and gifts. Our aim is not to standardize. It is to accompany. To document. To build tools that reflect what is already true.</p>
        <p>If your community is interested in hosting an ESTRI researcher, we invite conversation. We welcome your questions, your caution, your hopes. We do not seek to convince—we seek to align. If it is a fit, we will know through mutual recognition.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to reach out via our website, <a href="https://es-tri.org/contact.html" target="_blank">es-tri.org</a>, or directly to <a href="mailto:contact.estri@protonmail.com">contact.estri@protonmail.com</a>. We are excited to continue building this work in community—with intention, with care, and with the emergent unknown.</p>
