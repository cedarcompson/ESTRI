      <h2>Infrastructure Disclosure</h2>
      <p>ESTRI is currently hosted via GitHub Pages with domain services provided by GoDaddy. We do not endorse or align with these platforms’ broader practices, and we maintain only minimal reliance to ensure accessibility in our early development stage.</p>
      <p>Our email is currently handled through Proton (contact.estri@protonmail.com). We align with Proton AG’s commitment to privacy, autonomy, and human-aligned technology.</p>
      <p>We explicitly refuse integration with additional third-party services. Upon domain renewal in 2026, we will transition to <a href="https://njal.la/about/">Njalla</a> for registrar support, aligning with our values of anonymity, autonomy, and decentralization.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to self-host all digital systems, archives, and communications by 2028—on our own hardware, <a href="landtheory.html">land</a>, and terms.</p>
      <p>ESTRI is legally structured as a limited liability company (LLC) to hold and support our fieldwork with a recognized container. We chose to structure as an LLC rather than a nonprofit to preserve autonomy, protect identities, and resist institutional gatekeeping. We're partnering with <a href="https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/introduction">Open Collective</a> for fiscal sponsorship to enable transparent donations and resource-sharing while preserving our deeper field ethics. This hybrid model lets us stay flexible, stay accountable, and build outside the limits of traditional organizational forms.</p>
      <p>To maintain safety, privacy, and access for all members, we’ve partnered with <a href="https://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/privacy-by-default">Northwest Registered Agent</a> to serve as our registered agent and infrastructural intermediary for our LLC. Northwest aligns with our core values of autonomy, transparency, privacy, and non-extractive data practices. They limit what information is collected, code systems in-house, never sell data, and act as a shield between our personal identities and the public record.</p>
