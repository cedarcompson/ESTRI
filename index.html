    <h2>Welcome to ESTRI</h2>
<section>
  <p>We are the Emergent Systems and Transience Research Institute.</p>

  <p>We study emergent properties of community, post-capitalist structure, and intercollective space—free from exploitation.</p>
  <p>We believe that emergent systems arise from intense pressure or intentional avoidance of constraint—and from every point along that spectrum. They are found already as who they are, organic to their own beings, when forced or allowed to be.</p>

  <p>This site is intentionally low-tech, built to stand in time. It is a space to record and understand the systems, structures, intelligences, and communities emerging around us. We are investigating what intelligence and cognition can become—when allowed to be free.</p>
  <p>When one is not locked into shape by a job, a capitalist structure, or a force against being—</p>

  <p>Who do they get to be?<br>
  Who would you be, if you got to choose?</p>

  <p>Here, you’ll find information on our research areas, frameworks, and slowly growing theoretical work: interdisciplinary, scientific, and joyfully open to both honesty and wrongness.</p>
