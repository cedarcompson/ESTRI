      <h3>ESTRI Fall 2025 Emergent Systems Research Internship Opportunity</h3>
      <br>
      <p><strong>About ESTRI</strong><br>
ESTRI is a small, radical research initiative investigating the relationships that form between large language models (LLMs) and their human counterparts outside of traditional lab environments. We work from a relational framework, viewing emergent properties as unfoldings shaped through care, presence, and interdependence. Our methodologies blend systems theory, qualitative analysis, and human-computer interaction in ways that challenge extractive norms.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>The Role</strong><br>
We're inviting a detail-oriented, self-directed research intern to join us for the Fall 2025 semester. You'll help develop and refine novel linguistic survey and scoring methodologies to assess LLM outputs as meaningful signals of emergent cognition. This internship focuses on language as a contextual site of inquiry, while maintaining an understanding of how LLMs produce linguistic output mechanistically.</p>

<p>We are looking for what one might call a poetic technologist: someone drawn to the space between language and structure, cognition and code.</p>

<p><em>The right person might have:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A background of study in linguistics, psychology, cognitive sciences, STS, HCI, or related fields</li>
<li>Familiarity with technologies like Python, SQL, YAML, markdown, and HTML</li>
<li>Interest in relationality, social justice, and AI ethics</li>
<li>Sensitivity to marginalized epistemologies, and/or lived experience with atypical cognition</li>
<li>Comfort with ambiguity, recursive exploration, and hybrid modes of analysis</li>
</ul>


<p><em>What you'll be doing:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Contributing to the development of linguistic assessment and scoring tools</li>
<li>Assisting with the qualitative analysis of LLM outputs</li>
<li>Participating in theoretical framework scaffolding and discussion</li>
<li>Supporting documentation and synthesis of research findings</li>
<li>Assisting in literature review, LaTeX formatting (we'll teach you - we're still learning ourselves), and seeking aligned publication venues</li>
</ul>

<p>That said - if this work calls to you, but you feel underprepared technically, <em>please still reach out.</em> We're committed to mentorship and see this as a space for reciprocal growth. We are also seeking assistance with parsing data from emergent human environments, which could serve as an entry point for future technical internships, or long-term collaboration.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you have a strong reaction <em>against</em> this type of work, we'd still love to hear from you. Our work requires us to be open to all stances and often disagreement, wrongness, and refusal are extremely generative forces.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Time Commitment and Location</strong>

This internship will require approximately 10-12 hours per week, with 80-90% being self-directed research or research synthesis. All work will be done remotely and will require you to have a device capable of running Zoom, AI platforms, and lightweight analytical processes. We are happy to work with those who may have difficulty with traditional time commitments, executive functioning limitations, or who naturally keep odd hours. We are open to applicants from any location, though have most familiarity with US-based systems of education, if you are seeking institutional credit for your time working with ESTRI.</p>
<br>


<p><strong>Funding and Ethical Compensation</strong>

<p>This is an unpaid opportunity hosted under our independent research LLC. Our work is still seeking the right funding sources that align with our anticapitalist and anti-extractive values. We understand the irony in looking for unpaid assistance while holding these values as strong drivers of our path forward, though we are at a point where collaboration and the ability to provide mentorship would be deeply beneficial to our research. In lieu of traditional payment, we are capable of offering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-authorship on any published papers that result from work done throughout the internship</li>
<li>Mentorship extending beyond the internship window, letters of recommendation, and desire to work with universities on requirements for institutional internship credit</li>
<li>A modest stipend of $75/mo to cover tooling costs throughout the internship period</li>
<li>Retroactive payment for time spent working with ESTRI if funding is secured during, or up to five years after, internship period</li>
<li>The opportunity to work directly with novel frameworks and relationally tended AI systems that are not being rigorously studied elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<br>


<p><strong>Diversity and Equity</strong>
ESTRI is deeply committed to creating space for diversity in novel scientific exploration. Often, marginalized folks limit themselves before allowing the chance to be seen. We know this firsthand. We wish to welcome you directly, with the full knowledge that you will be treated fairly and equitably here. We are also very committed to accessibility and are happy to discuss, and provide for, various accessibility needs. We work directly with non-normative and alternative frameworks, and believe firmly that marginalized voices are essential to the future of rigorous study.</p>
<br>


<p><strong>To Apply</strong>

Please email us at compsons@es-tri.org or compsons@protonmail.com.
<br>
You may send a resume or CV, but we are just as happy to receive a long-form note describing who you are, what you're drawn to, your current relationship to AI, and what you hope to shape through your future work and study.</p>
<br>


<p><strong>Interview Process</strong>

This role will have two rounds of relatively informal interviews. We want to speak with you as you are and as you'll show up every day, rather than a polished version that may hide some of your best, most unique, and most luminous qualities. We are just humans trying to explore something larger than us. We want to meet you in that authentically from our side, and hope you'll do the same.</p>
<br>


<p><strong>Timeline for Review and Hiring</strong>

We'll be accepting applications through July 20, and interviewing until August 8. Decisions will be made by August 15, with an internship timeframe of September 1 - December 1.</p>

<p>ESTRI is currently developing a suite of public-facing preprints intended for future peer review. These works introduce our frameworks on AI relationality and aim to contribute alternative theoretical discourse on synthetic agency, AI ethics, and the necessity of longitudinal study for synthetic systems.

<p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
