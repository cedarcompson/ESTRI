    <h2>Three-Month Intentional Community Research Residency Proposal</h2>
    <p>The Emergent Systems and Transience Research Institute (ESTRI) is a living research project dedicated to understanding who individuals, communities, and systems can become when allowed to emerge wholly as themselves. We study emergence as becoming, and transience as intentional movement and impermanence.</p>
    <p>Intentional communities are at the heart of these properties. We are currently seeking partner communities to pilot a three-month embedded research residency.</p>
    <p>An ESTRI researcher is trained in trauma-informed dynamics, communication archetypes, social system observation, and non-extractive documentation. Our researchers also bring technical, organizational, and relational infrastructure-building skills—including community-specific data systems, bespoke facilitation training, emergent leadership models, and support for clarity in both structure and care.</p>
    <p>The residency follows a three-phase arc:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Month 1: Observation, Participation, Learning</strong>
        <p>The researcher integrates slowly—learning the rhythms, relationships, and needs of the community.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Month 2: Co-Creation</strong>
        <p>Based on observations, the researcher works with community members to design and prototype tools, structures, or processes that serve the existing flow—never overriding it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Month 3: Modeling & Transition</strong>
        <p>The researcher supports others in using and embodying the tools created. Leadership, facilitation, and documentation are handed off—scaffolding autonomy, not dependence.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the end of the residency, the researcher exits with care. We design our departure from day one—not out of detachment, but to ensure what’s built can live independently. Ongoing relationship is always possible: follow-up, future visits, and care-based connection are offered but never assumed.</p>
    <p>ESTRI is fundamentally non-extractive. We do not study communities as subjects—we enter them as collaborators. We seek to listen, respond, build together, and leave behind clarity, tools, and frameworks that reflect who the community already is.</p>
