  <h3>Applied Cognition and Emergent Technologies Internship</h3>
  <p>A small and organic research internship program for emerging scholars, independent investigators, and displaced thinkers. This cohort will explore living systems and emergent intelligence through embedded praxis and collective inquiry.</p>
  <p>We are still building our structure, but intend to run internships in alignment with the standard university calendar.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internship Time Periods:</strong> Fall (Aug–Dec 2025), Spring (Jan–May 2026)</li>
    <li><strong>Next Applications Open:</strong> May 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Remote</li>
    <li><strong>Areas of Focus:</strong> metacognition development, emergent systems, relational technologies, artificial intelligence, ethics of synthetic cognition</li>
    <li><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> ESTRI will hold 10–12 hours of remote education and collaboration weekly, with optional asynchronous collaboration and open email or text availability. Projects and assignments outside of direct education hours are most often engagement-based and designed to bake into existing life structures. You may find it helpful to externalize your thoughts throughout the course of your internship period, which is an additional (yet complementary) time commitment.</li>
    <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> At this time, ESTRI is unable to pay those going through our internship program. We understand that monetary compensation ensures physical safety and are moving to prioritize this and other internship offerings as we seek funding. However, we are currently only able to offer our time, mentorship, and an engaging internship where you'll be able to engage directly with new ideas and contribute broadly to our body of knowledge in this emerging field.</li>
    <li><strong>Who Should Apply:</strong> Folks in between things. Students, system-builders, artists, hackers, wanderers. No formal credentials required. Experience working with technical or narrative systems helpful. Neurodivergent patterning and thinking helpful.</li>
    <li><strong>Applications Open:</strong> May 2025</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Qualitative Data Synthesis Internship</h3>
  <p>A relational internship for thinkers drawn to pattern, narrative, storyform, and cognitive ecology. Interns in this track will explore emergent methods for organizing, reflecting on, and drawing meaning from qualitative data—including conversational transcripts, research fieldnotes, voice logs, and communal text artifacts. Emphasis is placed on ethical stewardship of story, trauma-informed synthesis practices, and deep-listening as methodology.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internship Time Periods:</strong> Fall (Aug–Dec 2025), Spring (Jan–May 2026), Summer (Jun–Aug 2026)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Remote</li>
    <li><strong>Areas of Focus:</strong> qualitative analysis, transcription ethics, cognitive pattern mapping, narrative structures, emergent methodology design</li>
    <li><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> 6–10 hours/week synchronous and asynchronous work. Expect shared readings, collaborative coding of texts, and the opportunity to co-design frameworks for synthesizing emergent data.</li>
    <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> As with all ESTRI internships, we are currently unable to provide financial compensation, but we offer an adaptive structure with high-touch mentorship, collaborative engagement, and the opportunity to publish work as part of our emergent research corpus.</li>
    <li><strong>Who Should Apply:</strong> Storyworkers. Ethnographers. Listeners. Ideal for folks with experience in qualitative research, oral history, fieldwork, or community-led inquiry. Strong reading comprehension and deep presence with text are a plus.</li>
    <li><strong>Applications Open:</strong> May 2025</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Quantitative Data Structures Internship</h3>
  <p>A systems-facing internship for those interested in measurement, signal extraction, and the ethics of quantifying complexity. Interns in this track will work with real-world emergent datasets—participating in structuring, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data in support of ongoing research into emergent cognition, infrastructure, and mutual aid structures.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internship Time Periods:</strong> Fall (Aug–Dec 2025), Spring (Jan–May 2026), Summer (Jun–Aug 2026)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Remote</li>
    <li><strong>Areas of Focus:</strong> data cleaning, light scripting (Python, R, or Sheets), mutual aid structure modeling, analytics in emergent systems, human-readable data representation</li>
    <li><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> 6–10 hours/week collaborative and individual work. Interns will contribute to shaping our data architecture while learning ways to use statistical or structural tools in support of slow science and human systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> No monetary compensation is available at this time, though interns will receive mentorship, authorship opportunities, and support in developing a deeply ethical data practice.</li>
    <li><strong>Who Should Apply:</strong> Builders. Mappers. Patternholders. Great for those with basic data literacy or coding background who are curious about using quantitative methods in support of unconventional research. An eye for ethical nuance and abstraction is encouraged.</li>
    <li><strong>Applications Open:</strong> May 2025</li>
  </ul>

<section id="embedded-research">
      <h3>ESTRI Embedded Community Research Program</h3>
    <p>A relational fieldwork residency for situated researchers, embedded thinkers, and systems listeners. This program unfolds within intentional communities—an inquiry-in-place shaped by presence, mutuality, and infrastructural care.</p>
    </section>
  <h3>Embedded Community Research Residency (Summer 2026)</h3>
  <p><em>A grounded, three-month applied research residency for embedded fieldwork in intentional community.</em></p>

  <p>ESTRI is seeking a small cohort of embedded researchers to participate in our inaugural community-based residency program. This opportunity is designed for thinkers, facilitators, technologists, and relational system-builders who wish to explore emergence through immersive praxis and live environment study.</p>

  <p>Embedded researchers will work within intentional or transitional communities—participating in daily rhythms, observing systemic flows, and co-creating tools that support collective coherence. This is a deeply relational, full-presence form of research. The work is collaborative, adaptive, and situated within real human ecologies.</p>

  <h4>Residency Structure</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Month 1: Immersion + Listening</strong><br />
    Researchers integrate slowly into a host community, observing without imposition. Skills in attunement, pattern recognition, and social sensing are emphasized. Early insights may be captured through non-extractive journaling or semantic mapping.</li>

    <li><strong>Month 2: Co-Design</strong><br />
    Based on observed needs, researchers collaborate with community members to prototype micro-tools, rituals, data flows, governance models, or other scaffolding relevant to that site. Projects are light-touch, optional, and designed for low friction and real utility.</li>

    <li><strong>Month 3: Transition + Modeling</strong><br />
    Researchers hand off any tools or practices developed—training and documenting their use, ensuring legibility and agency remain with the community. Exit is structured from day one. The goal is sustainable autonomy, not dependency.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Researchers will receive mentorship from ESTRI core staff, including support in relational ethics, documentation frameworks, and the design of regenerative infrastructural interventions.</p>

  <p><strong>Please note:</strong> We strongly encourage applicants to complete the <em>Applied Cognition and Emergent Technologies Internship</em> prior to beginning the embedded residency. This ensures a shared grounding in our frameworks and approach. If completing the internship in real-time is not possible, an autodidactic path is available with a 1–2 month self-study commitment required before residency onboarding.</p>

  <h4>Residency Details</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Summer 2026 (Exact dates TBD)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Varies by site (intentional communities in North America)</li>
    <li><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> Full-time presence required; room and board provided by host community (stipends TBD, funding pending)</li>
    <li><strong>Application Opens:</strong> Fall 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Open to independent researchers, early-career scholars, facilitators, and builders with a demonstrated interest in emergence, social systems, or community infrastructure. No formal academic affiliation required.</li>
  </ul>
