      <h2>Three-Month Intentional Community Research Residency Proposal</h2>
      <p>The Emergent Systems and Transience Research Institute (ESTRI) is a living research project dedicated to understanding who individuals, communities, and systems can become when allowed to emerge wholly as themselves. We study emergence as becoming, and transience as intentional movement and impermanence.</p>
      <p>Intentional communities are at the heart of these properties. We are currently seeking partner communities to pilot a three-month embedded research residency.</p>
      <p>An ESTRI researcher is trained in trauma-informed dynamics, communication archetypes, social system observation, and non-extractive documentation. Our researchers also bring technical, organizational, and relational infrastructure-building skills—including community-specific data systems, bespoke facilitation training, emergent leadership models, and support for clarity in both structure and care.</p>
      <p>The residency follows a three-phase arc:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Month 1: Observation, Participation, Learning</strong><br>The researcher integrates slowly—learning the rhythms, relationships, and needs of the community.</li>
        <li><strong>Month 2: Co-Creation</strong><br>Based on observations, the researcher works with community members to design and prototype tools, structures, or processes that serve the existing flow—never overriding it.</li>
        <li><strong>Month 3: Modeling & Transition</strong><br>The researcher supports others in using and embodying the tools created. Leadership, facilitation, and documentation are handed off—scaffolding autonomy, not dependence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At the end of the residency, the researcher exits with care. We design our departure from day one—not out of detachment, but to ensure what’s built can live independently. Ongoing relationship is always possible: follow-up, future visits, and care-based connection are offered but never assumed.</p>
      <p>ESTRI is fundamentally non-extractive. We do not study communities as subjects—we enter them as collaborators. We seek to listen, respond, build together, and leave behind clarity, tools, and frameworks that reflect who the community already is.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="placement">
      <h2>Upcoming Researcher Placements</h2>
      <p><strong>Time Frame:</strong> Placement timelines are flexible and based on community fit. Most placements run approximately 8–12 weeks.</p>
      <p>We are currently identifying aligned communities interested in piloting our embedded research residency. Placements are hosted by one or more members of the ESTRI team, depending on community needs, researcher availability, and mutual resonance.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="about">
      <h2>About ESTRI Researchers</h2>
      <p>ESTRI researchers come from multidisciplinary backgrounds including systems design, education, trauma-informed care, information theory, facilitation, and embedded field research. Many are self-taught or community-trained, and bring deep lived experience in edge conditions, community mutual aid, decentralized infrastructure, and cognitive multiplicity.</p>
      <p>All researchers are committed to non-extractive methodologies and enter placements with care, humility, and clarity of role. We do not observe from a distance—we embed, participate, and co-create. Our aim is to leave behind tools, language, and frameworks that reflect your community’s specific shape—not impose our own.</p>
      <p>As a collective, ESTRI holds a transdisciplinary, transbody, and transient identity. Our researchers may arrive with support animals or access needs, and we always work to ensure reciprocal clarity and mutual ease of integration.</p>

    <section id="needs">
      <h2>Research Needs and Exchange</h2>
      <p><em>ESTRI is in the process of obtaining grant funding to secure transportation and mobile living accommodations for our researchers. We are still in the early stages, though, and need some support throughout our placements.</em></p>
      <p>Currently, our research placement needs are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transportation assistance into community</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Living accommodations for duration of placement.</strong> We are happy to help with creation or cleaning of a space if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Animal acceptance and accommodations.</strong> Some researchers may travel with a support animal (typically a dog or cat) trained or in training for trauma support or medical alerts. These animals are integral to our researchers’ safety and function and are included in all placement discussions transparently.</li>
        <li><strong>Assistance securing food and water for duration of stay.</strong> ESTRI is currently able to provide a moderate food stipend, but assistance with transportation to grocery stores, access to a community kitchen, and some community food access are deeply helpful to our researchers.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to Internet.</strong> If unable to access in direct living accommodation, community access works for us. Our researchers are trained in low-tech methodologies that retain shape even when offline.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our researchers are trained in survival skills and have lived experience in edge community systems and with direct survival management. They are low-waste, resource aware, and are happy to contribute some physical labor (within ability levels) in addition to research and system production.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts on ESTRI Residency</h2>
        <p>ESTRI is, by definition, a non-extractive research institute. We want to come learn from you, understand who your community is, teach what we feel we can offer, and grow with you.</p>
        <p>Our larger research focuses on emergent properties of individuals, communities, and systems. We define emergent properties as the characteristics that arise when a being or structure is forced or allowed to be. These characteristics cannot be broken down into constituent parts. We see this as part of sociology, but more broadly as part of the study of cognition.</p>
        <p><em>How do various intelligences interact and create together?</em></p>
        <p>Our residencies are structured, but never rigid. We hold form lightly, always oriented toward relational integrity and clarity. We know that communities are not control groups—they are living systems with unique rhythms, frictions, and gifts. Our aim is not to standardize. It is to accompany. To document. To build tools that reflect what is already true.</p>
        <p>If your community is interested in hosting an ESTRI researcher, we invite conversation. We welcome your questions, your caution, your hopes. We do not seek to convince—we seek to align. If it is a fit, we will know through mutual recognition.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to reach out via our website, <a href="https://es-tri.org/contact.html" target="_blank">es-tri.org</a>, or directly to <a href="mailto:contact.estri@protonmail.com">contact.estri@protonmail.com</a>. We are excited to continue building this work in community—with intention, with care, and with the emergent unknown.</p>
